# Airbnb-Analysis

# Overview
The Airbnb Data Analysis and Visualization project is an extensive data exploration and presentation initiative. It encompasses data collection, preprocessing, ETL processes, and the development of an interactive Streamlit user interface. The project aims to provide insights and enhance the accessibility and understanding of Airbnb data.

# Features
Data Collection: Acquired Airbnb data from various sources, including MongoDB.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Converted data from MongoDB into structured DataFrames.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough analysis and visualization of Airbnb data.
Interactive Streamlit UI: Created a user-friendly interface for data exploration and presentation.
Tableau Dashboard: Developed an engaging and interactive dashboard with advanced filtering options.
